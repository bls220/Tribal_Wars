                   A game inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.



The objective of the game is to manage a group of tribesmen, raise a mighty fort,
build a massive army, and defend what is rightfully yours!
(from your friends and invaders)

Details:
* The map can be thought of as a cube, much like in DF.
* The graphics would preferably be like in DF as well, with one object being colored
	differently to 	correspond to different materials.
* Building materials should be gathered or dropped from mining.
* Eventually multiplayer.
* The game is free now, but may be added to google play for a small fee.
